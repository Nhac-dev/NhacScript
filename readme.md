# NhacScript
The script is a "shortener" for static javascript. The main objective of the project is to help your web developer. So I created a minimal version with my ideas and things made for me.
# Building
The readme in building, and a version backend!
The version is a test / first version, but soon new versions will appear, a website for better interpretation is being developed.
